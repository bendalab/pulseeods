# pulseeods
Test and validation recordings of pulse-type electric fish.

This repository is a collection of field recordings of weakly electric pulse-type fish. These field recordings are used to improve, test and validate the performance of the weakly electric fish analysis program [Thunderfish](https://github.com/bendalab/thunderfish).

The test (n=20) and validation (n=100) set include clean recordings of single fish with different EOD properties (simple versus complicated EOD waveform, low and high discharge rates), as well as more complicated recordings with two or more pulse-type (n=38) and also wave-type EOD waveforms (n=18). The test recordings cover a variety of typical fish-finder recordings, and were collected by four different researchers at four distinct locations, including both Mormyrids (n=4) and Gymnotiformes (n=116).

A csv file is included containing the path to the original files on the bendalab servers, recording locations, recording dates, data collectors, number of pulsefish, number of wavefish, rare waveforms, clipping, eel waveforms, and whether said recording belongs to the test or training dataset.
